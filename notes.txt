Can now find a simple positive proof.  Need to incorporate this into
the solver and see where it fails with test board 1.

If we are trying to prove that a board is invalid, we first prove which
numbers cannot go in each cell.  If we see that no number can go in a cell,
then we've proven it.  If we see that only one number can go into a cell,
we should go ahead and put that number there.

So we can spend a certain number of proof points to prove numbers can't
go in certain cells.  Then fill any groups that have a single solution
or return our proof if a group has no solution.

When proving a board is invalid, it should take the current set of
proofs as a parameter, and try to add to them.  So, we'll start
with no proofs, and then prove as much as we can with a single step.
If this doesn't lead to any contradictions or positive proofs, then
we go deeper.
